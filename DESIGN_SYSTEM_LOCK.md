DESIGN SYSTEM LOCK

1. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
- Calm
- Trustworthy
- Clinical-adjacent
- Neutral
- No visual hype

2. COLOUR SYSTEM (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- Backgrounds: gunmetal / dark charcoal
- Primary actions: dark green
- Text: white + muted grey
- RAG colours: informational only

Red / Amber / Green must NEVER be used as page or card backgrounds.

3. USAGE RULES
- Backgrounds: dark neutral only
- Cards: subtle contrast, no colour emphasis
- Buttons: green = action, not emotion
- Icons: neutral unless conveying RAG state

4. FORBIDDEN VISUALS
- Gradients
- Glow effects
- Gamification visuals
- Wellness / fitness tropes
- Bright accent colours

5. CHANGE CONTROL
Any visual change outside these rules requires explicit human approval.
